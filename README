INSTALLATION
------------
You need a running version of MacPorts on your machine. Please see http://www.macports.org for more details.

To setup this tools collection, you have to create a local MacPorts repository:
1- Pull this git repository to a local directory on your computer.
  mkdir -p /usr/local/MacPorts && cd /usr/local/MacPorts
  git clone git://github.com/hassemlal/MacPorts.git /usr/local/MacPorts

2- Edit the sources MacPorts configuration file (default: /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf) to add your local repository.
  sudo nano /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf
  add the line 'file:///usr/local/MacPorts' BEFORE any rsync line, 

3- Update the index of your local repository
  cd /usr/local/MacPorts
  portindex

This completes the setup process. You can now install tools using MacPorts.
  sudo port install minc
