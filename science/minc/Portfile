description       This package contains tools to manipulate MINC files.
long_description  The Minc file format is a highly flexible medical image file format built on top of the NetCDF generalized data format. The format is simple, self-describing, extensible, portable and N-dimensional, with programming interfaces for both low-level data access and high-level volume manipulation. On top of the libraries is a suite of generic image-file manipulation tools. The format, libraries and tools are designed for use in a medical-imaging research environment: they are simple and powerful and make no attempt to provide a pretty interface to users.
