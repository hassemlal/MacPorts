description       MNI Non-parametric Non-uniformity Normalization (N3) Package.
long_description  \
An artifact often seen in MRI is for the signal intensity to vary smoothly \
across an image.  Variously referred to as RF inhomogeneity, shading \
artifact, or intensity non-uniformity, it is usually attributed to such \
factors as poor radio frequency (RF) field uniformity, eddy currents driven \
by the switching of field gradients, and patient anatomy both inside and \
outside the field of view. \
 \
The perl script nu_correct implements a novel approach to correcting for \
intensity non-uniformity in MR data that achieves high performance without \
requiring supervision.  By making relatively few assumptions about the \
data, the method can be applied at an early stage in an automated data \
analysis, before a tissue intensity or geometric model is available. \
Described as Non-parametric Non-uniform intensity Normalization (N3), the \
method is independent of pulse sequence and insensitive to pathological \
data that might otherwise violate model assumptions.  To eliminate the \
dependence of the field estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is \
employed to estimate both the multiplicative bias field and the \
distribution of the true tissue intensities.  Preprocessing of MR data \
using N3 has been shown to substantially improve the accuracy of \
anatomical analysis techniques such as tissue classification and cortical \
surface extraction.
